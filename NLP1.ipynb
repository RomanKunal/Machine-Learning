O\\u2019Neil of the Justice Department\\u2019s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr.\\u00a0of the District of Columbia and Acting Special Agent in Charge Katrina W. Berger of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\\u2019s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) made the announcement.Merhay, 47, arrived in the United States on April 25, 2014, and made his initial appearance today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Deborah A. Robinson in the District of Columbia.   He was indicted under seal in the District of Columbia in 2012, and the charges were unsealed today.   Merhay has been in the custody of Moroccan authorities pending extradition since his arrest in Marrakech, Morocco, in August 2013.The indictment charges Merhay with one count of conspiracy to bring undocumented migrants to the United States for profit and 15 counts of unlawfully bringing an undocumented migrant to the United States for profit.   Court documents allege that Merhay operated with a network of smugglers in Africa, the United Arab Emirates, South and Central America, Mexico and elsewhere to coordinate and implement arrangements, including providing fraudulent identity and travel documents, for undocumented migrants to travel through Latin America and ultimately into the United States without authorization.   For up to $15,000, Merhay arranged for individual undocumented migrants to travel from points in Africa to a house or apartment in Dubai, where he provided travel documents, tickets and instructions for meeting other smugglers while on the way to the United States.   Merhay coordinated the migrants\\u2019 air travel to South America, where they would meet with Merhay\\u2019s associates, who would direct or guide them across the various country borders.   The undocumented migrants then met with other smugglers associated with Merhay and were further guided north to Mexico and then into the United States, sometimes by crossing the Rio Grande River by raft.The investigation was conducted under the Extraterritorial Criminal Travel Strike Force (ECT) program, a joint partnership between the Justice Department\\u2019s Criminal Division and ICE-HSI.   The ECT program focuses on human smuggling networks that may present particular national security or public safety risks or present grave humanitarian concerns.   ECT has dedicated investigative, intelligence and prosecutorial resources.   ECT coordinates and receives assistance from other U.S. government agencies and foreign law enforcement authorities.The investigation was conducted by HSI Washington.\\u00a0 This case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Jay Bauer of the Criminal Division\\u2019s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Frederick Yette of the District of Columbia.\\u00a0 The extradition was handled by Dan E. Stigall of the Criminal Division\\u2019s Office of International Affairs.The Department of Justice and HSI expressed their appreciation for the significant assistance provided by the Moroccan Ministry of Justice.The charges contained in the indictment are merely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.      \\u00a0\",\n          \"  Metropolitan Ambulance & First Aid Corp. (now known as SEZ Metro Corp.), Metro North Ambulance Corp. (now known as SEZ North Corp.) and Big Apple Ambulance Service Inc. (formerly known as United Ambulance) have paid the United States $2.85 million to resolve false claims made to Medicare, the Justice Department announced today. The United States stipulated to the dismissal of the False Claims Act qui tam suit against the companies, including their president, Steve Zakheim.   The United States alleged that the companies and Zakheim used, or caused the use of, falsified records to appeal a Medicare program refund demand. Medicare had demanded the companies return millions of dollars they had been paid for medically unnecessary ambulance trips. Under Medicare rules, the companies could bill for these expensive non-emergency transports only if the patient could not be transported by any other means, such as by car or by wheelchair van. Medicare audited the companies\\u2019 past billings and concluded that the companies had charged Medicare tens of millions of dollars for ambulance trips that did not meet this standard. Medicare demanded a refund and afforded the companies an extensive informal and formal appeals process to prove that their billings were proper.   The government contended that, rather than contesting the refund demand fairly, the companies resorted to fraud when they could not otherwise prove an ambulance was medically needed. According to the suit, in their ensuing appeals, the companies used, and Zakheim caused the use of, hundreds of letters attesting to the need for an ambulance that were forged or otherwise purported to come from some neutral, disinterested health care provider when they in fact did not.   \\\"Those who benefit from Medicare must play by the rules,\\\" said Tony West, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division of the Department of Justice. \\\"We will diligently protect taxpayer dollars from those who use fraud and deceit to take advantage of federal health care programs.\\\"   \\\"Healthcare providers who seek to defraud the Medicare program by submitting false documents will be vigorously pursued and held accountable for their fraud,\\\" said U.S. Attorney Loretta E. Lynch.   This action was originally filed by Larry Kaplan, a former Chief Financial Officer for one of the companies, under the False Claims Act. The qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions of the Act permit private citizens to file suit on behalf of the United States and share in any recovery. Mr. Kaplan\\u2019s share of the settlement announced today will be $618,450.   The investigation, litigation, and resolution of these allegations resulted from a coordinated effort by the Justice Department\\u2019s Civil Division, the U.S. Attorney\\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of New York, the Department of Health and Human Services\\u2019 Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.   The suit is United States ex rel. Kaplan v. Metropolitan Ambulance & First-Aid Corp. et al., Civil Action No. 00-3010 (E.D.N.Y.).   This settlement is part of the government\\u2019s emphasis on combating health care fraud. One of the most powerful tools in that effort is the False Claims Act, which the Justice Department has used to recover approximately $3 billion since January 2009 in cases involving fraud against federal health care programs.\",\n          \"  WASHINGTON \\u2014 The United States has filed a complaint against Louisiana Generating alleging that the company violated the Clean Air Act by operating the Big Cajun 2 Power Plant, a coal-fired power plant in New Roads, La., without also installing and operating modern pollution control equipment after the generating units had undergone major modifications, the Justice Department and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced today.\\u00a0   The complaint alleges that for more than a decade, the Big Cajun 2 Power Plant has operated without the best available emissions-control technology required by the New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air Act to control emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, contributing to formation of fine particulate matter, smog and acid rain.   The lawsuit, filed by the Justice Department on behalf of the EPA, asks the court to order Louisiana Generating to install and operate appropriate air pollution control technology in order to substantially reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from the Big Cajun 2 Power Plant.\\u00a0 The United States also seeks civil penalties up to the maximum amount authorized by law, as well as actions by the energy provider to mitigate the adverse effects alleged to have been caused by the violations.\\u00a0   Coal-fired power plants collectively produce more pollution than any other industry in the United States.\\u00a0 They account for nearly 70 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions each year and 20 percent of nitrogen oxides emissions.\\u00a0 Emissions from coal-fired power plants have detrimental health effects on asthma sufferers, the elderly and children.\\u00a0 Additionally, these emissions have been linked to forest degradation, waterway damage, reservoir contamination and deterioration of stone and copper in buildings.

Mohamud, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Somalia and former resident of Corvallis, Oregon, was arrested on Nov. 26, 2010, after he attempted to detonate what he believed to be an explosives-laden van that was parked near the tree lighting ceremony in Portland.\\u00a0 The arrest was the culmination of a long-term undercover operation, during which Mohamud was monitored closely for months as his bomb plot developed.\\u00a0 The device was in fact inert, and the public was never in danger from the device. At sentencing, United States District Court Judge Garr M. King, who presided over Mohamed\\u2019s 14-day trial, said \\u201cthe intended crime was horrific,\\u201d and that the defendant, even though he was presented with options by undercover FBI employees, \\u201cnever once expressed a change of heart.\\u201d\\u00a0 King further noted that the Christmas tree ceremony was attended by up to 10,000 people, and that the defendant \\u201cwanted everyone to leave either dead or injured.\\u201d\\u00a0 King said his sentence was necessary in view of the seriousness of the crime and to serve as deterrence to others who might consider similar acts.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u201cWith today\\u2019s sentencing, Mohamed Osman Mohamud is being held accountable for his attempted use of what he believed to be a massive bomb to attack innocent civilians attending a public Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland,\\u201d said John P. Carlin, Assistant Attorney General for National Security.\\u00a0 \\u201cThe evidence clearly indicated that Mohamud was intent on killing as many people as possible with his attack.\\u00a0 Fortunately, law enforcement was able to identify him as a threat, insert themselves in the place of a terrorist that Mohamud was trying to contact, and thwart Mohamud\\u2019s efforts to conduct an attack on our soil.\\u00a0 This case highlights how the use of undercover operations against would-be terrorists allows us to engage and disrupt those who wish to commit horrific acts of violence against the innocent public.\\u00a0 The many agents, analysts, and prosecutors who have worked on this case deserve great credit for their roles in protecting Portland from the threat posed by this defendant and ensuring that he was brought to justice.\\u201d \\u201cThis trial provided a rare glimpse into the techniques Al Qaeda employs to radicalize home-grown extremists,\\u201d said Amanda Marshall, U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon.\\u00a0 \\u201cWith the sentencing today, the court has held this defendant accountable.\\u00a0\\u00a0 I thank the dedicated professionals in the law enforcement and intelligence communities who were responsible for this successful outcome.\\u00a0 I look forward to our continued work with Muslim communities in Oregon who are committed to ensuring that all young people are safe from extremists who seek to radicalize others to engage in violence.\\u201d\\u00a0 According to the trial evidence, in February 2009, Mohamud began communicating via e-mail with Samir Khan, a now-deceased al Qaeda terrorist who published Jihad Recollections, an online magazine that advocated violent jihad, and who also published Inspire, the official magazine of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\\u00a0 Between February and August 2009, Mohamed exchanged approximately 150 emails with Khan.\\u00a0 Mohamud wrote several articles for Jihad Recollections that were published under assumed names. In August 2009, Mohamud was in email contact with Amro Al-Ali, a Saudi national who was in Yemen at the time and is today in custody in Saudi Arabia for terrorism offenses.\\u00a0 Al-Ali sent Mohamud detailed e-mails designed to facilitate Mohamud\\u2019s travel to Yemen to train for violent jihad.\\u00a0 In December 2009, while Al-Ali was in the northwest frontier province of Pakistan, Mohamud and Al-Ali discussed the possibility of Mohamud traveling to Pakistan to join Al-Ali in terrorist activities. Mohamud responded to Al-Ali in an e-mail: \\u201cyes, that would be wonderful, just tell me what I need to do.\\u201d\\u00a0 Al-Ali referred Mohamud to a second associate overseas and provided Mohamud with a name and email address to facilitate the process. In the following months, Mohamud made several unsuccessful attempts to contact Al-Ali\\u2019s associate.\\u00a0 Ultimately, an FBI undercover operative contacted Mohamud via email under the guise of being an associate of Al-Ali\\u2019s.\\u00a0 Mohamud and the FBI undercover operative agreed to meet in Portland in July 2010.\\u00a0 At the meeting, Mohamud told the FBI undercover operative he had written articles that were published in Jihad Recollections.\\u00a0 Mohamud also said that he wanted to become \\u201coperational.\\u201d\\u00a0 Asked what he meant by \\u201coperational,\\u201d Mohamud said he wanted to put an explosion together, but needed help. According to evidence presented at trial, at a meeting in August 2010, Mohamud told undercover FBI operatives he had been thinking of committing violent jihad since the age of 15.\\u00a0 Mohamud then told the undercover FBI operatives that he had identified a potential target for a bomb: the annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland\\u2019s Pioneer Courthouse Square on Nov. 26, 2010.\\u00a0 The undercover FBI operatives cautioned Mohamud several times about the seriousness of this plan, noting there would be many people at the event, including children, and emphasized that Mohamud could abandon his attack plans at any time with no shame.\\u00a0 Mohamud indicated the deaths would be justified and that he would not mind carrying out a suicide attack on the crowd. According to evidence presented at trial, in the ensuing months Mohamud continued to express his interest in carrying out the attack and worked on logistics.\\u00a0 On Nov. 4, 2010, Mohamud and the undercover FBI operatives traveled to a remote location in Lincoln County, Oregon, where they detonated a bomb concealed in a backpack as a trial run for the upcoming attack.\\u00a0 During the drive back to Corvallis, Mohamud was asked if was capable looking at all the bodies of those who would be killed during the explosion.\\u00a0 In response, Mohamud noted, \\u201cI want whoever is attending that event to be, to leave either dead or injured.\\u201d\\u00a0 Mohamud later recorded a video of himself, with the assistance of the undercover FBI operatives, in which he read a statement that offered his rationale for his bomb attack.\\u00a0 On Nov. 18, 2010, undercover FBI operatives picked up Mohamud to travel to Portland to finalize the details of the attack.\\u00a0 On Nov. 26, 2010, just hours before the planned attack, Mohamud examined the 1,800 pound bomb in the van and remarked that it was \\u201cbeautiful.\\u201d\\u00a0 Later that day, Mohamud was arrested after he attempted to remotely detonate the inert vehicle bomb rked near the Christmas tree lighting ceremony This case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Oregon State Police, the Corvallis Police Department, the Lincoln County Sheriff\\u2019s Office and the Portland Police Bureau.\\u00a0 The prosecution was handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Ethan D.

The consent decree lodged today resolves both state and federal NRD liability claims; it requires the parties to pay $1,094,169.56 to the state and federal natural resource trustees, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) and DOI, for injuries to ecological resources including groundwater and wetlands, which provide habitat for waterfowl and wading birds, including black ducks and great blue herons.  The trustees will use the settlement funds for natural resource restoration projects in the area.       \\u00a0       \\u201cThis settlement demonstrates our commitment to recovering damages from the parties responsible for injury to natural resources, in partnership with state trustees,\\u201d said Bruce Gelber, Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department\\u2019s Environment and Natural Resources Division.       \\u00a0       \\u201cThe citizens of Walpole have had to live with the environmental impact of this contamination for many years,\\u201d Attorney General Martha Coakley said. \\u201cWe are pleased that today\\u2019s agreement will not only require the responsible parties to reimburse taxpayer dollars, but will also provide funding to begin restoring or replacing the wetland and other natural resources.\\u201d         \\u00a0       The consent decree was lodged in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts.     A portion of the funds, $300,000, will be distributed to the EEA-sponsored groundwater restoration projects; $575,000 will be used for ecological restoration projects jointly sponsored by EEA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).       \\u00a0       In addition, $125,000 will go for projects jointly sponsored by EEA and FWS that achieve both ecological and groundwater restoration; $57,491.34 will be allocated for reimbursement for the FWS\\u2019s assessment costs; and $36,678.22 will be distributed as reimbursement for the commonwealth\\u2019s assessment costs.       \\u201cThis settlement provides the means for a range of projects designed to compensate the public for decades of groundwater and other ecological damage at this site.\\u00a0 I encourage local citizens and organizations to become engaged in the public process that will take place as we solicit, take comment on, and choose these projects in the months ahead,\\u201d said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Richard K. Sullivan Jr., who serves as the Commonwealth\\u2019s Natural Resources Damages trustee.       \\u201cThis settlement will help restore habitat for fish and wildlife in the Neponset River watershed,\\u201d said Tom Chapman of the FWS New England Field Office. \\u201cWe look forward to working with the commonwealth and local stakeholders to implement restoration.\\u201d       \\u00a0       \\u201cMore than 100 years-worth of industrial activities at this site caused major environmental contamination to the Neponset River, nearby wetlands and to groundwater below the site,\\u201d said Commissioner Kenneth Kimmell of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP), which will staff the Trustee Council for the Commonwealth. \\u201cWe will ensure that the community and the public will be active participants in the process to use these NRD funds to restore the injured natural resources.\\u201d        \\u00a0       Under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, EEA and DOI, acting through the FWS, are the designated state and federal natural resource Trustees for the site. The site has been listed on the EPA\\u2019s National Priorities List since 1994.        The consent decree is subject to a public comment period and court approval. A copy of the consent decree and instructions about how to submit comments is available on www.usdoj.gov/enrd/Consent_Decrees.html  .       \\u00a0       After the consent decree is approved, EEA and FWS will develop proposed restoration plans to use the settlement funds for restoration projects.

            "{\"id\": \"10-015\", \"title\": \"10 Las Vegas Men Indicted \\r\\nfor Falsifying Vehicle Emissions Tests\", \"contents\": \"  WASHINGTON\\u2014A federal grand jury in Las Vegas today returned indictments against 10 Nevada-certified emissions testers for falsifying vehicle emissions test reports, the Justice Department announced.   Each defendant faces one felony Clean Air Act count for falsifying reports between November 2007 and May 2009. The number of falsifications varied by defendant, with some defendants having falsified approximately 250 records, while others falsified more than double that figure. One defendant is alleged to have falsified over 700 reports.   The individuals indicted include:\\u00a0    Escudero resides in Pahrump, Nev. All other individuals are from Clark County, Nev.    The 10 defendants are alleged to have engaged in a practice known as \\\"clean scanning\\\" vehicles. The scheme involved entering the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) for a vehicle that would not pass the emissions test into the computerized system, then connecting a different vehicle the testers knew would pass the test. These falsifications were allegedly performed for anywhere from $10 to $100 over and above the usual emissions testing fee.    The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under the Clean Air Act, requires the state of Nevada to conduct vehicle emissions testing in certain areas because the areas exceed national standards for carbon monoxide and ozone. Las Vegas is currently required to perform emissions testing.    To obtain a registration renewal, vehicle owners bring the vehicles to a licensed inspection station for testing. The emissions inspector logs into a computer to activate the system by using a unique password issued to the emissions inspector. The emissions inspector manually inputs the vehicle\\u2019s VIN to identify the tested vehicle, then connects the vehicle for model year 1996 and later to an onboard diagnostics port connected to an analyzer. The analyzer downloads data from the vehicle\\u2019s computer, analyzes the data and provides a \\\"pass\\\" or \\\"fail\\\" result. The pass or fail result and vehicle identification data are reported on the Vehicle Inspection Report. It is a crime to knowingly alter or conceal any record or other document required to be maintained by the Clean Air Act.\\u00a0    \\\"Falsifications of vehicle emissions testing, such as those alleged in the indictments unsealed today, are serious matters and we intend to use all of our enforcement tools to stop this harmful practice. These actions undermine a system that is designed to reduce air pollutants including smog and provide better air quality for the citizens of Nevada,\\\" said Ignacia S. Moreno, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department\\u2019s Environment and Natural Resources Division.    \\\"The residents of Nevada deserve to know that the vast majority of licensed vehicle emission inspectors are not corrupt and are not circumventing emission testing procedures,\\\" said U.S. Attorney Bogden. \\\"These indictments should serve as a clear warning to offenders that the Department of Justice will prosecute you if you make fraudulent statements and reports concerning compliance with the federal Clean Air Act.\\\"    \\\"Lying about car emissions means dirtier air, which is especially of concern in areas like Las Vegas that are already experiencing air quality problems,\\\" said Cynthia Giles, Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Assurance at EPA. \\\"We will take aggressive action to ensure communities have clean air.\\\"    The maximum penalty for the felony violations contained in the indictments includes up to two years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.    An indictment is merely an accusation, and a defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law.    The case was investigated by the EPA, Criminal Investigation Division; and the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles Compliance Enforcement Division. The case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney\\u2019s Office for the District of Nevada and the Justice Department\\u2019s Environmental Crimes Section.\", \"date\": \"2010-01-08T00:00:00-05:00\", \"topics\": [], \"components\": [\"Environment and Natural Resources Division\"]}\n",
            "{\"id\": \"18-898\", \"title\": \"$100 Million Settlement Will Speed Cleanup Work at Centredale Manor Superfund Site in North Providence, R.I.\", \"contents\": \"The U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM) announced today that two subsidiaries of Stanley Black & Decker Inc.\\u2014Emhart Industries Inc. and Black & Decker Inc.\\u2014have agreed to clean up dioxin contaminated sediment and soil at the Centredale Manor Restoration Project Superfund Site in North Providence and Johnston, Rhode Island.\\u00a0 \\u201cWe are pleased to reach a resolution through collaborative work with the responsible parties, EPA, and other stakeholders,\\u201d said\\u00a0Acting Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey H. Wood for the Justice Department's\\u00a0Environment and Natural Resources Division . \\u201cToday\\u2019s settlement ends protracted litigation and allows for important work to get underway to restore a healthy environment for citizens living in and around the Centredale Manor Site and the Woonasquatucket River.\\u201d \\u201cThis settlement demonstrates the tremendous progress we are achieving working with responsible parties, states, and our federal partners to expedite sites through the entire Superfund remediation process,\\u201d said EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler. \\u201cThe Centredale Manor Site has been on the National Priorities List for 18 years; we are taking charge and ensuring the Agency makes good on its promise to clean it up for the betterment of the environment and those communities affected.\\u201d \\u201cSuccessfully concluding this settlement paves the way for EPA to make good on our commitment to aggressively pursue cleaning up the Centredale Manor Superfund Site,\\u201d said EPA New England Regional Administrator Alexandra Dunn. \\u201cWe are excited to get to work on the cleanup at this site, and get it closer to the goal of being fully utilized by the North Providence and Johnston communities.\\u201d \\u201cWe are pleased that the collective efforts of the State of Rhode Island, EPA, and DOJ in these negotiations have concluded in this major milestone toward the cleanup of the Centredale Manor Restoration Superfund site and are consistent with our long-standing efforts to make the polluter pay,\\u201d said RIDEM Director Janet Coit. \\u201cThe settlement will speed up a remedy that protects public health and the river environment, and moves us closer to the day that we can reclaim recreational uses of this beautiful river resource.\\u201d The settlement, which includes cleanup work in the Woonasquatucket River (River) and bordering residential and commercial properties along the River, requires the companies to perform the remedy selected by EPA for the Site in 2012, which is estimated to cost approximately $100 million, and resolves longstanding litigation. The cleanup remedy includes excavation of contaminated sediment and floodplain soil from the Woonasquatucket River, including from adjacent residential properties. Once the cleanup remedy is completed, full access to the Woonasquatucket River should be restored for local citizens. The cleanup will be a step toward the State\\u2019s goal of a fishable and swimmable river. The work will also include upgrading caps over contaminated soil in the peninsula area of the Site that currently house two high-rise apartment buildings. The settlement also ensures that the long-term monitoring and maintenance of the site, as directed in the remedy, will be implemented to ensure that public health is protected.\\u00a0 Under the settlement, Emhart and Black & Decker will reimburse EPA for approximately $42 million in past costs incurred at the Site. The companies will also reimburse EPA and the State of Rhode Island for future costs incurred by those agencies in overseeing the work required by the settlement. The settlement will also include payments on behalf of two federal agencies to resolve claims against those agencies. These payments, along with prior settlements related to the Site, will result in a 100 percent recovery for the United States of its past and future response costs related to the Site. Litigation related to the Site has been ongoing for nearly eight years. While the Federal District Court found Black & Decker and Emhart to be liable for their hazardous waste and responsible to conduct the cleanup of the Site, it had also ruled that EPA needed to reconsider certain aspects of that cleanup. EPA appealed the decision requiring it to reconsider aspects of the cleanup. This settlement, once entered by the District Court, will resolve the litigation between the United States, Rhode Island, and Emhart and Black and Decker, allowing the cleanup of the Site to begin. The Site spans a one and a half mile stretch of the Woonasquatucket River and encompasses a nine-acre peninsula, two ponds and a significant forested wetland. From the 1940s to the early 1970s, Emhart\\u2019s predecessor operated a chemical manufacturing facility on the peninsula and used a raw material that was contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a toxic form of dioxin. The Site property was also previously used by a barrel refurbisher. Elevated levels of dioxins and other contaminants have been detected in soil, groundwater, sediment, surface water and fish.\\u00a0 The Site was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) in 2000, and in December 2017, EPA included the Centredale Manor Restoration Project Superfund Site on a list of Superfund sites targeted for immediate and intense attention. Several short-term actions were previously performed at the Site to address immediate threats to the residents and minimize potential erosion and downstream transport of contaminated soil and sediment. This settlement is the latest agreement EPA has reached since the Site was listed on the NPL. Prior agreements addressed the performance and recovery of costs for the past environmental investigations and interim cleanup actions from Emhart, the barrel reconditioning company, the current owners of the peninsula portion of the Site, and other potentially responsible parties. The Consent Decree, lodged in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island, will be posted in the Federal Register and available for public comment for a period of 30 days.

Cadden, owner and head pharmacist of New England Compounding Center (NECC) and NECC\\u2019s supervisory pharmacist Glenn A. Chin were charged with 25 acts of second-degree murder in Florida, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 The outbreak was caused by contaminated vials of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) manufactured by NECC, located in Framingham, Massachusetts.\\u00a0 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 751 patients in 20 states were diagnosed with a fungal infection after receiving injections of NECC\\u2019s MPA.\\u00a0 Of those 751 patients, the CDC reported that 64 patients in nine states died.\\u00a0 Twelve other individuals, all associated with NECC, including six other pharmacists, the director of operations, the national sales director, an unlicensed pharmacy technician, two of NECC\\u2019s owners, and one other individual were charged with additional crimes including racketeering, mail fraud, conspiracy, contempt, structuring, and violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. \\u201cAs alleged in the indictment,\\u00a0these employees\\u00a0knew\\u00a0they were\\u00a0producing their medication\\u00a0in an unsafe manner and in insanitary conditions, and authorized it to be shipped out anyway, with fatal results,\\u201d said Attorney General Eric Holder.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u201cWith\\u00a0the indictment and these arrests, the Department of Justice is taking decisive action to hold\\u00a0these\\u00a0individuals accountable for their alleged participation in grievous wrongdoing.\\u00a0 Actions like the ones alleged in this case display not only a reckless disregard for health and safety regulations, but also an extreme and appalling indifference to human life.\\u00a0 American consumers have a right to know that their medications are safe to use, and this case proves that the Department of Justice will always stand resolute to ensure that right, to protect the American people, and to hold wrongdoers accountable to the fullest extent of the law.\\u201d \\u201cEvery patient receiving treatment deserves the peace of mind and knowledge that the medicine they are receiving is safe,\\u201d said Acting Associate Attorney General Stuart Delery.\\u00a0 \\u201cWhen people and companies violate that trust and break the law, the consequences to patients and their families can be catastrophic.\\u00a0 That\\u2019s why it remains a priority of the Department to use every tool at our disposal to protect patients\\u2019 safety and hold bad actors accountable.\\u201d \\u201cThose who produce and sell the drugs that we take have a special responsibility to make sure that they prepare those drugs under suitable conditions, and that what leaves their facilities is safe,\\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Joyce R.

Cadden, 48, of Wrentham, Massachusetts; Glenn A. Chin, 46, of Canton, Massachusetts; Gene Svirskiy, 33, of Ashland, Massachusetts; Christopher M. Leary, 30, of Shrewsbury, Massachusetts; Joseph M.

Conigliaro, 53, of Dedham, Massachusetts.\\u00a0\\u00a0 The 25 second-degree murders are included in the indictment as predicate racketeering acts under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).\\u00a0 These charges relate to patients who received NECC MPA and died in Florida, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. As a general matter, and depending on particular state law, second-degree murder does not require the government to prove Cadden and Chin had specific intent to kill the 25 patients, but rather that Cadden and Chin acted with extreme indifference to human life.\\u00a0 According to the indictment, Cadden and Chin knew that NECC was making MPA in a manner and in an environment in which they could not assure that the drug was sterile as it was identified to be.\\u00a0 Despite knowing that they were making the MPA in an unsafe manner and in insanitary conditions, Cadden and Chin nonetheless allegedly directed and authorized the shipping of MPA to NECC customers nationwide.\\u00a0 It is alleged that Cadden and Chin were aware that doctors would inject MPA into their patients\\u2019 bodies, and that if the MPA was not in fact sterile, it could kill them.\\u00a0 The 25 murder racketeering acts comprise only a portion of the broad racketeering scheme charged in the indictment.\\u00a0 The indictment also alleges that NECC\\u2019s other pharmacists knowingly made and sold numerous drugs in a similar unsafe manner and in insanitary conditions.\\u00a0 The unsafe manner alleged in the indictment includes, among other things, the pharmacists\\u2019 failure to properly sterilize NECC\\u2019s drugs, failure to properly test NECC\\u2019s drugs for sterility, and failure to wait for test results before sending the drugs to customers.\\u00a0 The insanitary conditions alleged in the indictment include, among other things, NECC\\u2019s lack of proper cleaning and NECC\\u2019s failure to take any action when its own environmental monitoring repeatedly detected mold and bacteria within NECC\\u2019s clean room suite of rooms throughout 2012.\\u00a0 It is further alleged that NECC repeatedly took steps to shield its operations from regulatory oversight by the FDA by claiming to be a pharmacy dispensing drugs pursuant to valid, patient-specific prescriptions.\\u00a0 In fact, NECC routinely dispensed drugs in bulk without valid prescriptions.\\u00a0 The indictment alleges that NECC even used fictional and celebrity names on fake prescriptions to dispense drugs.\\u00a0 Finally, the indictment charges Carla Conigliaro, the majority shareholder of NECC, and her husband Douglas Conigliaro with transferring assets following the fungal meningitis outbreak.\\u00a0 Specifically, the indictment charges that after NECC declared bankruptcy, and the bankruptcy court ordered the shareholders not to transfer assets, Carla and Doug Conigliaro transferred approximately $33.3 million to eight different bank accounts opened after the NECC bankruptcy.\\u00a0 Cadden and Chin face a maximum of up to life in prison if convicted on all counts.\\u00a0 \\u201cAlthough no VA patients were affected by the fungal meningitis outbreak, VA unknowingly purchased a variety of pharmaceutical products over a three year period from NECC that were intentionally produced in an unsafe manner under insanitary conditions,\\u201d said Assistant Inspector General for Investigations James J. O\\u2019Neill for the Office of Inspector General, Department of Veterans Affairs.\\u00a0 \\u201cWe are pleased to have contributed to this outstanding multi-agency criminal investigation.\\u201d \\u201cToday's results are part of an ongoing effort by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and its law enforcement partners to protect the integrity of the Department of Defense's health care program and the quality of care our service members receive,\\u201d said Deputy Inspector General for Investigations James B. Burch for the U.S. Department of Defense Office of the Inspector General.\\u00a0 \\u201cThe Defense Criminal Investigative Service will continue to pursue allegations of health care fraud that put the Warfighter at risk.\\u201d \\u201cThe U.S. Postal Inspection Service is pleased to join our federal partners in this announcement\\u201d said Postal Inspector in Charge Shelly A. Binkowski of the Boston Division.\\u00a0 \\u201cWhat's particularly disturbing about this case is that through their alleged misrepresentation and greed, these defendants put the health and well-being of others at a high level of risk.\\u00a0 This criminal action today demonstrates the commitment and vigilance of postal inspectors and other federal agents to pursue criminals who prey on the public in such an egregious way.\\u201d In announcing the indictment today, Attorney General Holder and U.S. Attorney Ortiz acknowledged the assistance and cooperation of Michigan State Attorney General Bill Schuette.\\u00a0 The state of Michigan had the most deaths during the outbreak. The investigation was conducted by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations and the FBI with assistance by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, U.S. Department of Defense, Office of Inspector General; Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General and U.S. Postal Inspection Service. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys George P. Varghese and Amanda P.M.

Caldwell of the Justice Department\\u2019s Criminal  Division, U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez for the District of Puerto  Rico, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Thomas Winkowski of U.S. Immigration  and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which oversees Homeland Security Investigations  (HSI), Chief Postal Inspector Guy Cottrell of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service  (USPIS), Chief Richard Weber of the Internal Revenue Criminal Investigation  Division (IRSCID) and Director Bill Miller of the State Department\\u2019s Diplomatic  Security Service (DSS) made the announcement.   \\u00a0   The  multi-count indictments were returned by a federal grand jury on Aug. 6, 2014.    Since that time, five of the defendants  have been found and arrested (four in Puerto Rico and one in Florida).   They will be arraigned in federal court this  week.   Arrest warrants have been issued  for the remaining defendants, who will make their initial appearances in federal  court in the districts in which they are arrested.   \\u00a0   According to  the indictments, from at least July 2008 through April 2014, conspirators in the  mainland United States and in Puerto Rico sold the identities and corresponding  Social Security cards, Puerto Rico birth certificates and other identification  documents of Puerto Rican U.S. citizens to undocumented aliens and others  residing in the mainland United States.   \\u00a0   Specifically, the indictments allege that individuals located in  the Caguas, Rio Piedras and San Juan areas of Puerto Rico (suppliers) obtained  Puerto Rican identities and corresponding identity documents, and conspirators  in various locations in the United States (identity brokers) solicited customers  for those identities and documents.   The  identity brokers allegedly sold the identities and documents to the customers  for prices ranging from $700 to $2,500 per set of Social Security cards and  corresponding Puerto Rico birth certificates.   \\u00a0   According to  the indictment, the identity brokers ordered the identity documents from the  suppliers by making coded telephone calls, including using terms such as  \\u201cshirts,\\u201d \\u201cuniforms\\u201d or \\u201cclothes\\u201d to refer to identity documents.   The suppliers generally requested that the  identity brokers send payment for the documents through a money transfer service  to names provided by the suppliers.   The  conspirators frequently confirmed payee names and addresses, money transfer  control numbers and trafficked identities via text messaging.   The suppliers allegedly retrieved the  payments from the money transfer service and sent the identity documents to the  brokers using express, priority or regular U.S. Mail.   \\u00a0   According to  the indictments, once the identity brokers received the identity documents, they  delivered the documents to the customers and obtained the remaining payment from  the customers.   The brokers generally  kept the second payment for themselves as profit.   Some identity brokers allegedly assumed a  Puerto Rican identity themselves and used that identity in connection with the  trafficking operation.   \\u00a0   As alleged  in the indictments, the customers generally obtained the identity documents to  assume the identity of Puerto Rican U.S. citizens and obtain additional  identification documents, such as state driver\\u2019s licenses.   Some customers allegedly obtained the  documents to commit financial fraud and others attempted to obtain U.S.  passports.   The  indictments alleges that various identity brokers were operating in  Indianapolis,   Columbus and Seymour,  Indiana; Aurora, Illinois; Bartow, Florida; Lawrenceville, Jonesboro and  Norcross, Georgia; Salisbury, Maryland; Columbus, Ohio; Lawrence and  Springfield, Massachusetts; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;  Houston, Texas; Guymon, Oklahoma; Huron, South Dakota and Albertville, Alabama.   \\u00a0   The charges  announced today are the result of Operation Island Express II, an ongoing,  nationally-coordinated investigation led by the ICE-HSI Chicago Office and  USPIS, DSS and IRS-CID offices in Chicago, in coordination with the ICE-HSI San  Juan Office.   The Illinois Secretary of  State Police provided substantial assistance.    The ICE-HSI Attach\\u00e9 office in the Dominican Republic, National Drug  Intelligence Center - Document and Media Exploitation Branch and International  Organized Crime Intelligence and Operations Center (IOC-2) provided invaluable  assistance, as well as various ICE, USPIS, DSS and IRS CI offices around the  country.   \\u00a0   The case is  being prosecuted by the Criminal Division\\u2019s Organized Crime and Gang Section,  with the assistance of the Criminal Division\\u2019s Human Rights and Special  Prosecution Section, and the support of the U.S. Attorney\\u2019s Office for the  District of Puerto Rico.   \\u00a0   Anyone who  believes that their identity may have been compromised by the crimes that are  the subject of to this investigation may contact the ICE toll-free hotline at  1-866-DHS-2ICE (1-866-347-2423) and its online tip form at    www.ice.gov/tipline .
